				Jesus said, "Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
				Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart,
				and you will find rest for your souls.
				For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."
			</p>

			<p>
				Hearts' Ease is a place of living, of learning, and of discipleship.
				This is where we see God's hand at work in his creation.
				And this is where we learn to serve one another through thick and thin.
				So while there are stresses and difficulties, they are mere ripples in a sea of peace.
			</p>
		</br>
			<p>
				When you can, come see and experience that which puts your heart at ease.

			Hearts' Ease was established in 2016 by Chouzoo.
			Michael Hartl, Lee Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
			sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a
			billion people, and probably more.
